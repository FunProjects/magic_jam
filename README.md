I kickstarted Ring (mainly because of the impassioned Japanese guy) when I had cash and was feeling impulsive.  Think it would be cool to learn this shit and do a project around it.


So this is Ring: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1761670738/ring-shortcut-everything?ref=dash

Here is their fun little gesture maker: http://logbar.jp/developer/

Some initial projects that could be fun using this tech:
magic DJ - use that software that allows js controllers. Set gestures to JS commands.  Wave your had around to make music.
Magic DJ2 - Use a digital looper. Set gestures to different loops and stuff. Wave your hands around to make music.

Wizard Duel - make an app called "magic wand".  Gestures activate the other persons app.  Maybe voice activation in there too.  If a gesture is successful, The other person loses a point or something like that.

other - What are some sweet projects?
